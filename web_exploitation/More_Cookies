we notice in the challenge description the letters C B C are capitalized, referring to the CBC (cipher block chaining)
the cookie auth_name looks b64 encoded(it has = in the end which indicates base64 padding). We'll have to write a script
that flips each bit at a time, we'll try to xor each byte block with every number from 1 to 127 (byte = 8bits meaning
possible values for a byte are from 1 to 127), this will flip each bit of the original byte, the goal is to try to flip the
bit that indicates that we have access, the python script More_Cookies.py gives us the flag.
