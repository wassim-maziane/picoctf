#we open the file with a hexeditor

#we notice the BM at the start of the file, this indicates that the file is a bitmap file, we rename it with a .bmp extension
#now we can open the file with the display command, and its says sorry{not_a_flag}
display tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp
#we can also see BAD repeated twice at offset 0A and offset 0E, this might mean that the file has been corrupted.
#we can look up the bmp file format on wikipedia, we can see that at offset 0A, we should have the starting address of the bitmap image data
#According to wikipedia, the file has a bitmap file header with a size of 14 bytes and a bitmap information header.
#the most common format is the bitmapinfoheader, which we can see has a size of 40 bytes.
#14 + 40 is 54, converted to hex is 38. at offset 0A, we replace the BA with 38 and the D with 0
#next at offset 0E, we should have the size of the bitmapinfoheader, which is 40 in decimal, 28 in hex
#we replace the BA with 28 and the D with 0
#looking at the bitmapinfoheader, we find at offset 16 we should find the bitmap height in pixels, let's try increasing that.
#we find the number 3201, we increase it to 3202, the image got bigger. we increase it to 3203, and the flag appears on the top of the screen

#you can compare the modified tunn3l_v1s10n that is in this directory with the unmodified tunn3l_v1s10n if something is unclear.
